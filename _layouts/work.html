    <p>A collection of projects I have on the go</p>
    <p>See what I build on when I'm not working on proprietary enterprise <span class="emphasis">Angular</span> apps</p>
    <p class="italics">(They're cool too, but I can't show them off)</p>
    <p>Lately I’ve been thoroughly enjoying experimenting with <span class="emphasis">design</span>; it’s challenging in different ways than I’m used to, and it’s a fun creative outlet</p>
    <p>I’ve also jumped on the <span class="emphasis">React</span> train and am having a blast learning and being a React beginner</p>

        <h2>Phillippa's Blog</h2>
        <p>Phillippa is an amazing resident physician, and her blog will be a showcase of both lifestyle posts and medicine</p>
        <p>She is awesome, so you should check out what she’s up to</p>
        <p>The development of her website is an ongoing pair effort between myself and Nick Houghton, in which I’m handling the design</p>
        <p>The blog is built using Jekyll</p>

        <h2>Blog Prototype</h2>
        <p>Often when I make websites for other people, we’ll go through a couple design iterations (sometimes complete redesigns) before we land on the right one</p>
        <p>This was a design iteration which ended up being discarded and completely redesigned, but I’m saving it as a potential candidate for the next time I get the urge to redo my own website</p>
        <p>Built using Jekyll</p>

        <h2>Artist Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Nicole is much more talented at design than I am, and this is demonstrated by her impressive portfolio of work</p>
        <p>Despite this, I’m designing her website</p>
        <p>The development of the site is ongoing and as more content is organized, more features will be added</p>
        <p>I built the website using Gatsby, which was my first introduction to React. I’m now a big fan of React and Gatsby</p>

        <p>Built an imitation Youtube as a fun experiment to start learning React using create-react-app and the Youtube API</p>
        <p class="italics">(Yes, its default search is "donuts")</p>
        <p>Deployed to Heroku</p>
        <p>I’m looking forward to digging deeper into React and taking full advantage of its capabilities</p>
