I’m a serial technical blog reader and have learned so much through the shared explanations and input of other developers. It’s ~~terrifying~~ intimidating to think about adding your voice to such a talented crowd but since I have found it so helpful to read others insights, this will be a thinking-out-loud place for my own learning in hopes that it will help someone else. Also serving the dual purpose of helping me organize my own thoughts....

### Who am I?

I am a recent graduate of University of Victoria in Engineering and am a learning and growing software developer currently working in Los Angeles as a Front End Engineer. I work mostly with Angular but in my spare time I work on projects using other Javascript technologies as well as Ruby on Rails.

### Now what?

I’m going to start off easy and throw out some picks of my absolute favorite resources I’ve come across in the technical world. Blogs, newsletters, podcasts, etc I’m all over it. There are *so many* smart people out there with really useful stuff to say.


I spend a ridiculous amount of time sitting in a car (<span class="emphasis">#LA</span> <span class="emphasis">#TrafficLifestyle</span>) and the one thing I’ve found that keeps me sane while I’m inching forward on the 405 is listening to podcasts. I don’t consider myself a hugely successful audio learner (lectures never worked for me) but I’ve found listening to podcasts is helpful to get an overarching view on a concept, and then I can use that to do my own research later.


One of my favorite go-to's is the [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues) podcast by [Devchat.tv](https://devchat.tv/). Episodes range from explanations of specific Ruby/Rails technologies, to integrating front end technologies with Rails, to developer experiences in Rails, to learning/teaching advice. The panelists are awesome and the guests are always super knowledgable. If you’re into Ruby on Rails or learning about Ruby on Rails, definitely check it out.


Another favorite is the [Adventures in Angular](https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular) podcast, also by Devchat.tv. Similar idea to Ruby Rogues, it covers a variety of topics in the Angular world and some of the panelists speak on both podcasts. As with Ruby Rogues, the guests are always awesome. I have found the episodes on [RxJS](https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/rxjs-with-angular) and [NGRx](https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/ngrx-with-mike-ryan) especially interesting as RxJS is something I use daily at work and I’m interested in how the use of NGRx could have made the project more efficient. (RxJS is something that I seriously struggled with when onboarding onto my current job and is something that I still struggle to find concise and complete explanations of…. Maybe a blog post for later).


[ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com/) and [Front End Happy Hour](http://frontendhappyhour.com/) are two podcasts that I listen to somewhat less regularly than Ruby Rogues or Adventures in Angular simply because they span such a wide range of topics (basically anything and everything when it comes to front end technologies). But whenever I see a new episode that’s talking about a technology that I’m learning about or actively using I always check it out. Also a cool way to learn about new technologies you may not have explored otherwise.


Lastly, [Angular Air](https://angularair.com/) is one that I’ve come across quite recently and has some really good content. Many episodes are more suited to a watch and listen environment than purely listening as they often go over code examples and demos. Thus not as conducive to listening to in the car but a great resource if you have the time to watch.


If you know of any podcasts that I didn’t list here that I should be listening to… let me know! Tweet me or email me, I’d love to check them out.
